Program Overview:
This Python-based program is designed to generate bathymetry files for the CE-QUAL-W2 hydrodynamic and water quality model, a widely used tool for simulating two-dimensional, longitudinal, and vertical water bodies like rivers, lakes, and estuaries. The program facilitates the creation of bathymetric data by processing topographic contour data and the centerline of a river or water body. By automating the bathymetry generation process, this tool helps modelers streamline the preparation of input data for CE-QUAL-W2.

Input Requirements:
To use this tool, users must provide three key input datasets:

1. Topographic Contours: The contours should be supplied as a shapefile, with an elevation attribute that the program will use to generate the bathymetry. It's important that the contour shapefile is free from geometry errors, such as dangling or self-intersecting lines, which could lead to processing issues.

2. River Centerline: This shapefile represents the main axis of the river. It must contain a 'Segment' column that correlates with the CE-QUAL-W2 segments and should not intersect with multiple W2 segments.

3. W2 Segments: A shapefile defining the W2 model segments, which must also include a 'Segment' column. Each segment should correspond to a CE-QUAL-W2 segment number, following the numbering conventions of the model (i.e., the first segment is 2, the second is 3, and so on).

Key Features and Assumptions:
The tool expects the W2 segments and centerline shapefiles to use CE-QUAL-W2's active segment numbering system. Please see the example file. 
Inactive cells are automatically accounted for by the program, meaning users do not need to include them in the input dataâ€”the program will insert inactive cells into the output where necessary.
This process ensures that the bathymetric data aligns correctly with the CE-QUAL-W2 model grid, providing an accurate representation of depth and riverbed structure for subsequent simulations.
By using this bathymetry generator, CE-QUAL-W2 modelers can save significant time in creating accurate bathymetric inputs and avoid potential errors in manually configuring bathymetric layers.
